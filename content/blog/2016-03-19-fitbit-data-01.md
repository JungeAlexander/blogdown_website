title: Analyzing my Fitbit data. Step 1 - Downloading Fitbit data via the API

In January, I bought a [Fitbit Charge HR](https://www.fitbit.com/chargehr) wristband which,
besides counting my steps, also monitors my heart rate, tracks my sleep and more.
One reason to buy the device was that I wanted to analyze and visualize my own
Fitbit data and thus get a better understanding of my day-to-day activities and
simply have some fun playing with data I generated myself.
I am currently thinking about writing a series of blog posts describing how I
progress with my analysis and what I learn along the way.

## Approach

I created a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/JungeAlexander/fitbit-data)
to share my code and plots which I will continuously update as I progress.
The first step of the analyses was to download my Fitbit data in a programmatic
way. Although the Fitbit website allows users to easily download their data,
writing a script which downloads the data itself is of course much better to
maintain in the future.
To download my data, I used the [python-fitbit](https://github.com/orcasgit/python-fitbit)
Python client which makes it easy to access the Fitbit API using Python.
I documented my workflow in a
[Jupyter notebook using the Python3 kernel](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JungeAlexander/fitbit-data/blob/master/Fitbit-data-01.ipynb).
I invite you to have a look if you are interested.

## Next steps

Next steps in this project will involve visualizing and modelling of the data
and I will update my blog once I have something to write about.
