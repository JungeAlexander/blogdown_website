title: First (minor) contribution to scikit-learn

[scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) is a popular open source machine learning library
for Python. I have been using the library for about two
years now and finally had the chance to make a minor contribution
to its development.

For those that are new to machine learning and/or Python:
scikit-learn provides outstanding [documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.html)
and a great set of [examples](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/index.html)
demonstrating the development of powerful machine learning pipelines in Python.

## Refactoring a couple of unit tests

The scikit-learn development team makes it easy for
newcomers to contribute to the project by
labelling specific issues listed on GitHub
as ['Easy'](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AEasy).
These problems are especially beginner-friendly and a good place to start when first contributing to
the library.

About two weeks ago, I decided that I wanted to give back
to the community and contribute to the project source code.
My first [pull request](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/7677) refactored a couple of unit tests
(corresponding [issue](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/7533)).
After a couple of iterations on my changes and very nice
feedback from the core developers,
my contribution has now been merged with the main code base.

## Future contributions

Open source projects can only survive by ongoing support
from the community. I will thus try my best to make
regular further contibutions to scikit-learn (or other projects)
in the future and encourage every reader to do so, too.
