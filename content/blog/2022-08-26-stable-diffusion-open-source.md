This is the obligatory post playing with text-to-image diffusion models recently made very popular by tools
such as OpenAI's [DALL-E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) or Google's [Imagen](https://imagen.research.google).

If you ever want to try this out yourself, I highly recommend
[starting with this open-source implementation of stable diffusion](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/diffusers/stable_diffusion.ipynb#scrollTo=Ylscg48YYxfF).

A bit more theory of stable diffusion is available [here](https://huggingface.co/blog/stable_diffusion) with some interesting research questions collected [here](https://twitter.com/tomgoldsteincs/status/1562503814422630406).
