Two weeks ago, I attended the kick-off meeting of phase 2 of the [Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) program](https://druggablegenome.net/).
A `pdf` of our poster presented at the meeting is available [here](/posts/2018-03-26/IDG2-F2F.pdf).

The IDG program aims to shed light on understudied drug targets - proteins that are members of three protein families commonly targeted by drugs (G-protein coupled receptors, ion channels, protein kinases) that themselves have not attracted much research attention.
The IDG Consortium is supported by the NIHâ€™s Common Fund and my postdoctoral research is currently funded by the IDG grant. As our contribution to the program, we aim to use biomedical literature mining to shed light on understudied drug targets.
One of the main results of the first phase of the IDG program is the knowledge portal [Pharos](https://pharos.nih.gov).

After attending the kick-off meeting, we met with the [group](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/bionlp/) of Zhiyong Lu at the US National Library of Medicine (NLM) for a fruitful discussion of current research projects.
