I am back at the NCBI/NIH to visit the [BioNLP research group](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/bionlp/) led by Zhiyong Lu.
The goal of my visit is to identify disease-associated genomic variants using text mining and natural language processing approaches as well as to establish a long-term collaboration between the BioNLP lab at NCBI and the JensenLab at CPR.
I will be staying at NCBI for 1.5 months and my research goal is to incorporate text mining for genetic variants from [LitVar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Lu/Demo/LitVar/) into [DISEASES](https://diseases.jensenlab.org/) to find variant-disease associations.

I am also delighted to announce that my research stay here in the US is funded by an [EMBO Short-term fellowship](http://www.embo.org/funding-awards/fellowships/short-term-fellowships).
