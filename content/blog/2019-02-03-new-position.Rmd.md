On February 1st 2019, I left my position as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of 
Copenhagen and started working as a data scientist in pharmaceutical R&D at Novo Nordisk A/S. I look forward to contributing to many exciting project and will perhaps write about some of the key differences I perceived when working in academic and industrial reserarch here.
