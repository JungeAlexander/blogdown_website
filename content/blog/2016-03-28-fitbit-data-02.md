This post documents cleaning of my Fitbit daily step and sleep data and also
a simple approach to looking for trends in the data.
This is a continuation of my last post on this blog.

## Approach

First of all, please check my last post
[Analyzing my Fitbit data. Step 1 - Downloading Fitbit data via the API]({{BASE_PATH}}/2016/03/19/fitbit-data-01),
if you haven't read it yet.

The code for the present post is once more compiled and explained with many in-line comments in a
[Jupyter notebook using the Python 3 kernel](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JungeAlexander/fitbit-data/blob/master/Fitbit-data-02.ipynb).
Thus I will not reiterate the analysis steps here.
In brief, the notebook describes how I cleaned my step data by removing
outliers and how I used detailed sleep log data to compute the number of minutes I slept each day.

I do, however, want to share the two final plots created in the analysis showing
the [rolling mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average) of my daily step
and sleep data between end of January and end of March 2016:

As described in the [Jupyter notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JungeAlexander/fitbit-data/blob/master/Fitbit-data-02.ipynb),
sleep counts are measured in minutes.

## Next steps

Before drawing conclusions about potential correlations between my daily step and sleep data,
I would like to gather additional data over the next months and then return to this analysis.
The reason is that I do not think that I can draw valuable conclusions from only two months of data right now.
I came to realize this while performing the analyses described in this post.

Once I collected more data, I would furthermore like to investigate whether my activity and sleep patterns depend on the day of the week.
