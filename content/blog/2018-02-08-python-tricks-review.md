I recently read 'Python Tricks: The Book. A Buffet of Awesome Python Features' by Dan Bader which is available [here](https://dbader.org/products/python-tricks-book/).
I absolutely recommend buying the book if you would like to level up your Python coding skills.

The aim of the book is to provide easily digestible Python code recipes that you can use to make your code more robust as well as easier to understand and maintain (both by your future self and your collaborators).
I found myself quickly making use of what I learned in the book in my everyday coding.
I thus think that the book lives up to what I expected of it.
All recipes are self-contained which means that you can freely jump between chapters.
Of course, this also means that you will notice a little bit of repetition between recipes in case you decide to read the book from back to back.

The notes I took while reading the book are available [here](https://github.com/JungeAlexander/notes-on-python-tricks-the-book)
