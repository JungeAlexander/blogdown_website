As this website and blog are slowly taking shape, I would like to explain a few words about its inception.

The website and blog are built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a blog-aware static site generator written in Ruby. It is hosted for free on GitHub using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). You can see and fork the page source code [here](https://github.com/JungeAlexander/JungeAlexander.github.io).

This setup allows me to modify the website and write blog posts in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) in a terminal window. After pushing changes to GitHub, an HTML version of the website will automagically be generated. The output is what you are looking at right now. I added a short video at the end of this post showing how a new blog article can be published using Jekyll and GitHub pages. I especially enjoy that there is no need for me to edit any HTML sources or use a blog editor interface in the browser. Plus, both website and blog are always under `git` version control.

I would like to use this blog to write about interesting things I come across in my everyday research work as a bioinformatician. I furthermore regard it as a platform to supplement tweets I publish on my [Twitter profile](https://twitter.com/JungeAlexander). Only time will tell how frequently I will actually update this blog but right now I am planning to write about one post each week.

Hope you are enjoying this website and blog! I am looking forward to read your comments to my posts.

Alex
