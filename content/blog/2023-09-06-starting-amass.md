Major personal news today:

I have joined [amass](https://www.amass.tech) as a co-founder solving challenges every life sciences researcher and R&D organization is facing: 

1. How to keep up with scientific knowledge, in all its shapes and sizes, both internally and externally?
2. How to make optimal decisions by synthesizing new insights based on this knowledge?
   
To solve these, amass is creating a scientific memory relying on recent advances in AI such as LLMs and multimodal representations. üß†üßë‚Äçüî¨üß™üìí

When my co-founders Christian Lawaetz Halvorsen and Henrik Jensen showed me an early prototype, I simply could not resist the opportunity to join forces with them because what I saw blew me away.
I am beyond excited to turn our pilots into a full product next.
Recent AI progress gives us the tools to build products like ours solving problems I have worked on, thought about, and experienced first-hand during my whole career in the life sciences.

We have big plans to reinvent knowledge discovery in the life sciences, tapping into both internal and external knowledge sources, going way beyond just searching text in documents.
Follow us on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/33893399) for more information.
Currently, we are running successful pilots and raising funding, reach out if you want to know more.

Last but not least, I would like to thank my colleagues at Corti for the last years: this has been an amazing growth experience for me and that allowed me to meet so many great Cortians.
