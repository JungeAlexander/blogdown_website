Today I added an [Atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(standard)) feed to my blog to make it easier for readers to follow my updates. As mentioned earlier, this site and blog are powered by [Jeykll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and I used the [Jekyll feed plugin](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-feed) to generate the Atom feed.

You can subscribe to the feed by adding it to your favorite feed reader: [![Blog subscribe]({{BASE_PATH}}/assets/feed-icon-24px.png)](feed.xml)
