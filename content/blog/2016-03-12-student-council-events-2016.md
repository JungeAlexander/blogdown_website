# Volunteering in the ISCB Student Council (ISCBSC)

I first learned about the ISCBSC when I attended the Student Council Symposium 2013
which preceded the ISMC/ECCB conference in Berlin, Germany.
I was really impressed by the motivation and professionalism with which
undergraduate and graduate students from all around the world jointly organized
a very inspiring symposium. Back then I decided that I would like to support
the ISCBSC as a volunteer and today I am happy to serve as the
ISCBSC's Vice Chair.

For further information about the ISCBSC, check our [website](http://iscbsc.org/).
If you would like to volunteer in the Student Council, you can either fill
in this [form](http://iscbsc.org/volunteer) or contact me directly and I will
put you in touch with the Student Council's Volunteers Committee.
