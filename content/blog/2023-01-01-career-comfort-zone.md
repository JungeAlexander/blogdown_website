One of my leadership principles is that a leader is responsible for growing their team
as a group and as individuals.
Tackling new challenges is core to inidividual growth.
This is advice I gave other academics that were stuck in a rut and I stand by it:

Main points

1. Exposure to people and groups outside the current job if one wants to make a career change.
2. If one makes a change, especially the first job after academia, it's more important to take that step rather than trying to look for the absolute dream role from the start. There is often the option to shape a role to your liking or, if that is not possible, look for another role. This will be much easier after that first step has been taken.
3. Looking beyond daily struggles is motivating because it tells you there is always something else out there. â†’ building life and work you love
4. Specific to DS and ML: Be broad in skills (technical, people, product knowledge, running projects, influencing others) but be specific (data science and ML - find a domain and build domain knowledge)
