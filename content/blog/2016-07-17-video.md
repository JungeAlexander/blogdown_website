A short video where I talk about our clustering project of large-scale data
sets of RNA molecules was released last week.

We recently developed a [Docker container](https://www.docker.com/) to ship
[RNAscClust](http://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de/Software/RNAscClust/),
our RNA clustering software.
This makes it very easy for new users to install our software since the container
wraps a complete computing environment with all dependencies already installed.
A more detailed description of our clustering project is available under
[Current projects]({{BASE_PATH}}/pages/projects.html#curr).

The video was produced by [DeiC](https://www.deic.dk/?language=en),
the Danish supercomputing organization, and I am featured in the video because
I won computing time in the
[CBioVikings Computerome pitch competition](http://cbiovikings.org/events/past/pitch.html)
back in March.
This allowed me to run our clustering software on
[Computerome](https://computerome.dtu.dk/),
the Danish National Supercomputer for Life Sciences, on big data sets.

The video is available on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/xg79E2wY9Zk?t=94) and the
part I am in is only about one minute long.
So please watch it, if you are interested.
