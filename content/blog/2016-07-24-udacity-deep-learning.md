title: Review - Google's Deep Learning Course on Udacity

I followed the 'Deep Learning' course developed
by Google, freely available on
[Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730)
over the past couple of weeks.
In a brief summary, the course provides a nice overview about the 'hot'
field of Deep Learning including a set of interesting coding assignments.
The course does, however, not replace reading a textbook/the papers introducing
the topics presented to understand the theory.

## Course Overview

The course covers roughly the following topics:
intro to neural networks (NNs);
logistics classifiers and (stochastic) gradient descent;
deep NNs;
regularization;
convolutional NNs;
embeddings;
long short-term memory recurrent NNs.
Furthermore, basic ML concepts such as splitting your data into train,
test, and validation set are explained.

It consists of 4 lessons with ~10 short, 2-3 minute videos and a total of
6 programming assignments.
The videos are presented by
[Vincent Vanhoucke](http://vincent.vanhoucke.com/),
Principal Scientist at Google,
and contain lots of simple drawings which make it easy to understand the
course materials.
I spent about two hours watching and summarizing the videos in each lesson
and 2-3 hours on each of the assignments.

## Course assignments

Speaking of the course assignments:
The assignments come as
[Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/)
hosted on GitHub.
This makes it really easy to understand how the different pieces
of code provided by the course organizers fit together.

Overall, the assignments provide a great intro to Google's ML library
[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).
If you are short on time, simply looking at the code provided for the
assignments will give you a basic understanding of how deep NNs can be
implemented using TensorFlow.

The problems presented in the assignments are quite interesting, e.g.,
classifying characters in the
[notMNIST](http://yaroslavvb.blogspot.dk/2011/09/notmnist-dataset.html) data
set.
One drawback is however, that not a lot of effort was made to clearly
specify the sub-tasks in each assignments.
This will force course participants to spend quite some time searching the
course forums for clues. This is not a huge problem since the course
forums are quite active but this is something that
could definitely be improved in coming iterations
of the course.
