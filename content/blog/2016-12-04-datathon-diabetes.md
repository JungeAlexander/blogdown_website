In the beginning of November, I attended the [Datathon for Diabetes](http://datathonfordiabetes.weebly.com/) in Copenhagen.
The aim of the event was to spend a weekend crunching data sets to address diabetes, a major global health care challenge.

Our team looked into relationships between socio-economic factors and diabetes risk. We found a correlation between diabetes and
depression using public Danish survey data.
Our code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/JungeAlexander/datathon_diabetes) and we very much welcome contributions.
