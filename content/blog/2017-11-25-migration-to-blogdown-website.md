Today I migrated my website from a Jekyll+GitHub Pages setup to a blogdown+Hugo+Netlify setup and am very happy with the result. This post collects a couple of links I found useful in the process and that others may find helpful, too:

- [blog post](https://blog.rstudio.com/2017/09/11/announcing-blogdown/) announcing the blogdown package.
- for picking a theme, check the list of [minimal themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/tags/minimal/)
- [chapter 4 in the blogdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/from-jekyll.html) helps which migration from Jekyll (the whole book is freely available online and very helpful)
