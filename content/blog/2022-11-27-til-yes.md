```shell
$ yes


```

```shell
$ yes no

```

## What is this good for?

At first no idea but after some research, the following use cases come to mind:

- repeatedly answer yes, no, or whatever via stdin, e.g. rm
- write repeated lines to file `$ yes Hello test | head -n 100 > test.txt`
- CPU cores to 100%
