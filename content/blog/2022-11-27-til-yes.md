Today (well, earlier this week but let's not be picky here) I learned about the Unix core utility `yes`.
It works like this:

```shell
$ yes
y
y
y
# [ad infinitum until killed]
```

```shell
$ yes no
no
no
no
# [ad infinitum untill killed]
```

As you can see, `yes` either prints `y\n` until killed or whatever string you pass it followed by a newline,
again continuing until the process is killed.

## What is this good for?

At first, I had no clear idea what `yes` could be used for but after some research, the following use cases appeared:

- repeatedly answer yes (or no, or whatever) via stdin to commands that require user input, e.g., to `rm *.json` or `apt install something`
- write repeated lines to a file `$ yes "Hello test" | head -n 100 > test.txt`
- getting CPU load to 100% for load testing - essentially `yes` is just a `while True` loop

Consider adding `yes` to your toolbelt, if this sounds useful.
Thanks for reading and let me know if you found other good use cases for `yes`.
