[CoCoScore](https://github.com/JungeAlexander/cocoscore), our Python library for computing context-aware co-occurrence scores for text mining applications, has been accepted at [BLAH4 (Biomedical Linked Annotation Hackathon 4)](http://blah4.linkedannotation.org/home). The hackathon will take place in Kashiwa, Japan, on January 10-13, 2018. By presenting CoCoScore at BLAH4, we hope to encourage collaboration around the idea of implementing a novel, context-based approach to score co-occurring biomedical entities in a text corpus. 

Source code (currently under active development) and usage examples are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/JungeAlexander/cocoscore) and our proposal will soon be published via the [BLAH4 website](http://blah4.linkedannotation.org/program).
