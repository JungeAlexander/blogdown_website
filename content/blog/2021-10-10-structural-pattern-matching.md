Structural pattern matching (aka the match statement) is a new feature introduced in Python 3.10 which was released on October 4th, 2021.
A GitHub repository where I will explore and practice using structural pattern matching and other new features with data science use cases in mind is available [here](https://github.com/JungeAlexander/py310_new_features).

Below is an example of a match statement used to parse a messy CSV file.
Time will tell how much constructs like this wild be used in production code.
The match statement could be a good alternative to deeply nested if-else-blocks to achieve the same outcome.

Check the [repository](https://github.com/JungeAlexander/py310_new_features) for more and updated examples. Any feedback or pull requests are highly appreciated.
