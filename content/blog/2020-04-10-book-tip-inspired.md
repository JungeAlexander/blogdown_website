I recently read the book 'Inspired: How to Create Tech Products Customers Love' by Marty Cagan and can wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone interest in learning more about digital product management.

Split into many short chapters, the book covers everything from case stories describing the work of successful product managers (PMs) at big tech companies to developing product roadmaps, stakeholder management, and discovering which products are worth building in the first place. The last bit is heavily influenced by the ideas of design thinking.

The book conveys a few central messages, for example:

- Always focus on outcomes, not output.
- If a product succeeds, the whole team delivered; if a product fails, it's the PMs fault.
- Good product teams consist of missionaries, not mercenaries.

... and a lot more (I took pages and pages of notes while reading). I very much look forward to applying all the principles  and ideas presented in this book in my daily work which will soon focus more on product ownership/management (more on that soon).

Bonus: The author also publishes articles via the ['Insight' blog](https://svpg.com/articles/).
