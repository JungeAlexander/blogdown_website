Thank you for visiting my personal homepage!

My name is Alexander Junge, I am CTO and co-founder of [amass technologies](https://www.amass.tech) where
we are building a scientific memory to fuel life sciences R&D.
I live in Copenhagen, Denmark, with my family.

Before that, I was Head of Machine Learning at [Corti](https://www.corti.ai), a HealthTech Series A scale-up
bringing machine learning to support conversations between healthcare professionals and
patients where it matters most.

Before that, I worked as a Senior Data Scientist in pharmaceutical R&D at Novo Nordisk.
In 2017, I obtained a PhD degree in RNA Bioinformatics and afterward I was a postdoctoral researcher in biomedical text mining. More information about me and my CV can be found below. You may furthermore be interested in my [projects](/projects) and [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=80t0eDYAAAAJ&hl=en) I worked on during my time as a PhD student and postdoctoral researcher.

From time to time I also write about my research and general interests on my [blog](/blog).
